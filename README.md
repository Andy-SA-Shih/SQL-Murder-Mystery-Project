# SQL-Murder-Mystery-Project
- I solved this mystery using my own way.
- Please see https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries for the database and mystery problem description (Thank you for offering this fun exercise).
- I first wrote the SQL codes in SQLite Studio on MacBook, resulting in a .sql script file.
- I also used Jupyter Notebook to integrate SQL codes with Python using Pandas, resulting in the second .ipynb file.
